# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the code and findings from my exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The analysis was completed as part of Task 2 during my internship at Prodigy.

## Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for machine learning and statistical modeling tutorials. It contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic.

## Task Completed

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and ensured data integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored relationships between variables and identified patterns and trends in the data using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights

- **Survival Rates by Passenger Class**: Discovered higher survival rates among passengers in higher classes.
- **Age Distribution of Survivors**: Explored the age distribution of survivors and non-survivors.
- **Impact of Gender and Age**: Analyzed the survival rates based on gender and age groups.
